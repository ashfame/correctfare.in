Idea
----

The idea originated from the fact that commuters are often charged incorrectly because of faulty meters and inflated fare slab tables. Now we can't do much about faulty meters, but we surely can keep note of fare slab tables on our end. So, to have an app which can do that and without internet looks like the best option, as not everyone has a data pack.

What's this then?
-----------------

The site [correctfare.in](http://correctfare.in) is a HTML5 web app which is totally capable of working offline without any internet connection. So once you load it in your mobile browser and then you can open this up again even when you are offline & it will do its job of calculating the cost according to the meter reading.

Whenever you run this app while connected to the internet, it will see if there are updates available & if so, will download them quitely, totally seamless!

Its totally free (infact opensource) & free from any sort of bullshit, just pure experience!

This is how it looks like right now (1st iteration):

Platforms supported
-------------------

Web + iOS + Android


How to contribute?
------------------

The hardest part is to keep the fare slab tables updated. So that's the whole reason why this app is opensourced, so that anyone can contribute either by updating fare slab tables or code wise to add more functionality.
